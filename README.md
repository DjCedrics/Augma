We are living in an era where conveying information is everything. The way you convey that information is just as important as the information itself and we thought that current options just doesn’t cut it. We felt like writing 120 characters or even posting a picture with a lengthy paragraph under it isn’t enough. We wanted to add another dimension to our conversations. This is where Augma was born. Augma adds a new layer to our reality and lets our posts come to life.

Augma is a mobile-app which lets you leave location based notes that come to life with the power of Augmented Reality technology. You can leave pretty much anything you want ranging from a plain text to pictures you draw. After you have left your note somewhere, other people who look through their phones cameras will be able to see your creation. These notes will be time limited and people who see these notes will be able to influence their time limits by upvoting. You can think of Augma notes like a graffiti that doesn’t get you to jail since it’s in another dimension.

You will have the choice to make your note visible to all other people or just certain groups by using Augma’s Circle system. You can even create your own small scale circles to leave private messages to your friends and family. You will even have the option to leave notes only you can see for personal reminders. With the usage of the Circle system, you will be able to personalize your window to this new layer of reality. You will have the option to see the notes that are only from the certain circles you specified. This will allow you to filter the notes in the augmented world.

Augma will also feature a heat map in which you can see where the places with lots of notes are. When you get to a “Hot Zone” like this, you will receive a notification on your phone prompting you to have a look around even when the app is running in the background. If you have your map open, when you get close enough to a note, you will be able to see an indication and a small preview of the note. With this function you will be able to determine if there are notes you want look at without actually having to open your camera. If you have low battery or your phone isn’t powerful enough or maybe you just don’t like having to turn around with your phone to actually see the Augmas world, you can click on these previews to see the notes like a picture taken from the perspective of their creators.

Another one of Augma’s big features will be the Augma ads. Companies will be able to leave very creative ads in the Augma’s world for a much cheaper price than in real life. Think about seeing a giant yellow M on the moon when you look through your camera at night if you are near a Mc`Donalds. This will allow for much more interesting ads and the best part is, now the big companies won’t have to pollute the scenery with their giant ads.
